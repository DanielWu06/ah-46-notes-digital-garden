# Technology
- Remote sensing
	- Getting information without physically seeing/interacting
	- Uses electromagnetic waves, not cameras
- Multispectral imaging
	- Imaging along the light spectrum
	- Not limited to visible spectrum
- Stereo pair imagery
	- Two images taken on the same pass
		- Slightly different angles each time
	- Mapped to create high-resolution elevation model
	- Functions similar to human eyes

# Case Study 1: Hermopolis
- Hermopolis
	- Modern day el-Ashmunein in Middle Egypt
	- Founded in Old Kingdom
	- Capital of 15th Upper Egyptian Nome
	- Main cult center of Thoth and later Hermes
- Current Situation
	- Urban encroachment by agricultural villages
	- Rising groundwater table threatens remains
- Features at ground level
	- Thick surface vegetation
	- Mudbrick remains
- Analysis using satellite data
	- Vegetation health + iron oxide
		- Vegetation health may indicate structures under the ground
		- Iron oxide (from mudbrick) may point to more mudbrick remains
	- Processing the images
		- Filter by spectral signatures, find density of vegetation
		- Mudbrick construction acts as a natural fertilizer: healthier/denser vegetation indicates mud brick buried underground
- What was found
	- Storage structures
	- Casemate structures
		- Contained rectilinear or squared rooms
		- Thick walls and regular structure
		- Filled with sand, earth, brick, or rubble

# Case Study 2: Abu Simbel Temple

- Abu Simbel temple complex
	- Two large temples carved into sandstone rock cliff
		- Great Temple of Ramesses II
		- Smaller temple for Nefertari
	- Used to commemorate military success against Hittites
- Flooding of the Nile
	- Nile flood necessitated the creation of Aswan High Dam
	- Dam would have created a reservoir and temple would have been submerged
	- In 1964, the monument was dismantled and moved to higher land
- Current Situation
	- Rising water means it is getting closer to same issue
	- Area is seismically active
		- Microearthquakes increasing

# Case Study 3: Dura Europos

- Situation
	- During ISIS control, was looted and used as storage
