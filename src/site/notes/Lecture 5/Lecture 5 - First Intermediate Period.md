# Overview
- [[Lecture 1/Lecture 1 - Introduction to Ancient Egypt#^7d0239\|Comes after Old Kingdom on the timeline]]
- Function of the tomb
	- Protecting (maybe concealing?) the deceased
	- Marking the place of burial
	- Commemorate and memorialize
		- Depends on type of tomb
		- Some more individual
		- Some more for an institution (ie kingship)
		- Some more dedicated for worship
	- Establish and communicate identity
	- Passage to the afterlife
- Intermediate period vs kingdom
	- Kingdoms marked by unification under a strong king
	- Intermediate periods have more political conflict, multiple kings, etc
		- Decentralized politics
		- Chaotic periods

## Stela of Maaty and Dedwi #SlideID
![stelamaatydedwi.png|196x273](/img/user/Images/stelamaatydedwi.png)
- Follows many Ancient Egyptian art conventions
	- Very large figure, striding, etc
	- Deceased in front of offering
- Relatively lower quality
	- Used to think this pointed to societal collapse
- Background
	- Paint on limestone
	- Likely from Naga ed-Deir
	- First intermediate period

# Chronology of the First Intermediate Period
![fipbigmap.png|294x344](/img/user/Images/fipbigmap.png)
- End/Late Old Kingdom (Memphis)
	- c. 2181-2160 BC
	- Dynasty 7-8
	- No longer a single king on the throne
	- Succession issues, fractures in royal sphere
- First Intermediate Period (Herakleopolis)
	- c. 2160-2025 BC
	- Not a lot of monuments or texts
	- Dynasty 9-10
- First Intermediate Period (Thebes)
	- c. 2125-2004 BC
	- Dynasty 11 (first half)
	- These guys become kings of the Middle Kingdom
		- Main reunifiers of Egypt

# Potential Reasons of the "Collapse"
- Governmental problems
	- Top-heavy social pyramid
	- Officials overpowering the king
	- Dynastic troubles and other succession issues
- Economic problems
	- Lack of resources (big ass pyramids)
	- Taxes
- Environmental problems?
## Climate Change
- One of the leading theories
- Evidence suggests a period of aridity
	- Potential famine or food shortage
- Issues
	- Unsure if abrupt or very gradual
	- Proxy data (climate data) hard to correlate with historical events

# Transition from the Old Kingdom
- No single moment when OK ends and FIP begins
- Why do we think of the FIP as a major time of chaos?
	- Admonitions of Ipuwer
	- Instruction for Merikare
	- Prophecy of Neferti
	- Written from the perspective of elites, showcases the chaos during the time
		- Might not be fully historical, maybe used to bolster legitimacy?

## Problems of Dynasties 7-8
- Single king at Memphis who gives decrees
	- Suggests some level of centralization and power
- After Pepi II, c.200 years of no royal monumental buildings
	- Gradual reduction of power?
### Pyramid of Ibi
![pyramidofibi.png|382x203](/img/user/Images/pyramidofibi.png)

## Common vs Royal Egyptians
- Increase in tombs, grave stelae, and other grave goods for common people
- Increase in economic growth at the lower level
	- Growing towns
	- No major economic collapse at the end of the Old Kingdom
- Marked difference between OK and FIP (Dynasties 9-11)
- One ruler in OK, multiple concurrent rulers in FIP
- No major monumental structures

### Royal Perspective
- Often erased or separated FIP dynasties and kings
	- For example, clean break between Dynasty 8 and Dynasty 9
	- Complete lack of names of FIP in Abydos King List

## List of First Intermediate Period Kings
![fipkings.png|588x341](/img/user/Images/fipkings.png)
- Mostly local kings
- Nebheptre eventually reunifies Egypt

# Art, Grave Goods, and Other Things from FIP
- Marked increase in regionalism
	- Decentralized government = decentralized production
	- Maybe leads to the decline in quality?
- Changes due to regionalism
	- Emergence of new styles
	- Very distinct Upper and Lower splits in stylistic choices
- Innovations in artistry
	- New styles/content
	- Different methods of production
	- Paint, carving, proportions, etc
- Effects of regionalism
	- Worse quality, yes
	- Expanded access
		- Explains increase in common grave goods
		- More people begin to be represented in art
## "Democratization of the Afterlife"
- Art goods remain a high-middle class commodity
- Afterlife access expands, but is still incredibly elite
- Rather, should be seen as an expansion outside of the royal sphere

## Naga ed-Deir Stele
![nagaeddeirstele.png|419x353](/img/user/Images/nagaeddeirstele.png)
- Showcases how some places begin to develop special styles
	- Helps place objects that are not found in situ
	- Suggests a workshop or some sort of art school in the area?

## Theban Stele
![thebanstele.png|539x308](/img/user/Images/thebanstele.png)
- Stela of Maaty (FIP) in top left
- OK stela in bottom right
- Differences
	- More offerings in OK stela
	- Different artistic representation
	- Different purpose/style?

## Stela of a Nubian
![stelaofnubian.png|356x281](/img/user/Images/stelaofnubian.png)
- Still has differences in depiction
	- Darker skin
	- Red sash around waist
- However, indicates increase in interaction with Nubia
	- At this point, suggests Nubians settling in Egypt
	- Follows Egyptian conventions: assimilation?
## Wooden Tomb Models
![woodentombmodels.png|528x298](/img/user/Images/woodentombmodels.png)
- Shows an expansion of tomb practices outside of royals
- Wooden tomb models as a replacement for extravagant wall paintings of OK
	- For (relatively) lower-class individuals
	- Expands to more of the Egyptian population
