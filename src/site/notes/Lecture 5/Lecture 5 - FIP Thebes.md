# Thebes in the First Intermediate Period
![fipthebesbigmap.png|530x420](/img/user/Images/fipthebesbigmap.png)
- Location of the rulers of part of FIP

## Karnak in the 11th Dynasty
![karnak.png|455x271](/img/user/Images/karnak.png)
- At this point, the site is still very small
- However, this pillar is engraved with an 11th dynasty king name
	- Suggests that we already started during this time
- Continues to grow in power over Egyptian history

## Regional Tomb Style: Saff Tombs
![safftomb.png|558x312](/img/user/Images/safftomb.png)
- Tombs were cut into the cliffsides of Thebes
- Usually had a forecourt, then more carved into the cliff face
- Still retains a lot of aspects of Egyptian art convention
	- Wall paintings
	- Daily life scenes
- Suggests the growth in power of local leaders

# Nebhepetre Montuhotep
![nebhepetre.png|563x338](/img/user/Images/nebhepetre.png)
- Local king of Thebes
- Clears out Herakleopolis and unifies Egypt

## Pre and Post Unification art
![prepostneb.png|525x337](/img/user/Images/prepostneb.png)
- Earlier art still very FIP-esque
	- Chunky, not very well made
- Later art returns to Old Kingdom form
	- Transition into Middle Kingdom

<span class="hide-in-garden">**Back:**</span>
- Definitely not a pyramid
	- Follows more of the regional saff style
- Opening court area
	- Processional way
	- Venerate king or local gods
	- Statues flanking the processional way
- Small room in the back is a shrine
- Serves as a sort of temple/shrine thing
- Badly preserved, so we do not really know what it looked like

### Fake Tomb
![nebstatues.png|253x266](/img/user/Images/nebstatues.png)
- Middle top-ish right side
- Black skin
	- Ties to god Osiris
- Robes tying him to the [[Lecture 4/Lecture 4 - Step Pyramid of Djoser#^ce7d6b\|heb-sed]]
- Probably ceremonial burial

- List of people he plans to smite
- People with feathers = foreigners
- Some Egyptians being smited
	- Very rare, won't see often
	- Internal conflict?
- Violent reunification wars
