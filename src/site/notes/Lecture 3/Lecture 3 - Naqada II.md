	- Animals of different varieties
	- More designs
## Figurines (N2){ #97cf37}

## Pottery (N2) #SlideID
![naqada2pottery.png|400x248](/img/user/Images/naqada2pottery.png)
- Decorated ware
- Different motifs from Naqada I pottery
	- No longer a focus on humans controlling nature
	- Begin to see greater human-centered emphasis
		- Boats

	- Still a lot of nature (boats and water, etc)
	- Interaction, less domination

## More Pottery (N2) #SlideID
![naqada2potteryextra.png|246x276](/img/user/Images/naqada2potteryextra.png)
- In this one, we see similar motifs to [[Lecture 3/Lecture 3 - Predynastic Upper Egypt#^97cf37\|Naqada II figurines]]
- Purposes
	- Maybe religious or spiritual
	- We find these in graves a lot, but again cannot deduce their purpose

- Ambiguous as if Naqada I or II, but likely II
- Found in graves
	- Not sure purpose
	- Maybe was a wall hanging

# Hierakonpolis in Naqada II

	- Specifically, a lot of themes similar to the [[Lecture 3/Lecture 3 - Predynastic Lower Egypt#^3e4231\|Narmer Palette]]
- Importance of medium (wall)
	- Belief that things painted on walls were real or manifest
	- Anchored to the site
- Important symbology: the crook
