## More Pottery (N1) #SlideID
![naqadaIpotteryextra.png|163x160](/img/user/Images/naqadaIpotteryextra.png)
- Similar designs as before
- We see nature motifs again
	- This time, not so much in regards to human control
	- A big theme was nature by itself
	- Other big themes included human control over other humans
- A lot of pottery is found in graves
	- However, we can't conclude that they were exclusive part of funerary practices
