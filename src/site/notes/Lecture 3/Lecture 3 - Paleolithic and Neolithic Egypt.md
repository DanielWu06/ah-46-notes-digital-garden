# Prehistoric Egypt
- Definition of prehistory
	- Before written history
- How can we learn about a society without writing?
	- Monuments and other structures
	- Tools
	- Tombs

## Mask of the Merimde Culture
![|300](/img/user/Images/image 1.png)
- Clay mask (probably) of a human face
- One of the earliest human representations from Egypt
- c. 4800-4300 BCE
	- Originated from the Merimde Culture

# Early Egyptian Chronology
{ #ea2ce2}


- Paleolithic (c. 500,000 - 7000 BP)
	- Lower (500,000 - 250,000 BP)
	- Middle (250,000 -(50,000 BP)
	- Upper (50,000 - 24,000 BP)
	- Late (24,000 - 10,000 BP)
- Neolithic
	- Sharan Neolithic (c. 8800 - 4700 BCE)
	- Lower Egyptian Neolithic and Chalcolithic (c. 5300 - 3200 BCE)
- Upper Egyptian Predynastic
	- Badarian (c. 4400 - 3800 BCE)
	- Naqada I/Amratian (c. 3900 - 3650 BCE)
	- Naqada II/Gerzean (c. 3650 - 3300 BCE)
	- Naqada III (c. 3300 - 2950)
		- Overlaps with Dynasties 0 and 1
- Notes and observations about the chronology
	- Use of BP (before present) indicates a long time in the past
	- Begins our [[Lecture 1/Lecture 1 - Introduction to Ancient Egypt#^9ab30d\|dynastic chronology]]

## Paleolithic and Neolithic Map
![|300](/img/user/Images/image-1 1.png)
# Paleolithic Period
- Lower Paleolithic
	- Acheulean complex: symmetrical tools worked on both sides
	- Associated with *Homo erectus*
		- Early humans (the ones who left Africa and such)
	- Bifacial hand axes
		- Used a smaller stone to chip the larger stone
		- Associated with food procurement/preparation
		- Suggest hunting
- Middle Paleolithic
	- Made with Levallois flaking
	- Mousterian sites in Western Desert and Nubia
	- Climatic conditions similar to Lower Paleolithic, maybe slightly more arid
	- Can extrapolate food-gathering, potential use of spears to hunt, etc
	- Maybe increasing population, but hard to tell due to Nile erosion/alluviation
	- First burial of an Egyptian child c. 55,00 BP at site of Taramsa-1 near Qena
- Upper Paleolithic
	- Very absent period, little evidence
	- Maybe very arid, hard to live in period
	- Also possible that settlements were closer to the Nile and thus information was lost
- Late Paleolithic
	- Significant cultural developments
	- Great variety in stone-tools (such as development of bow and arrow)
	- Diversified environments
	- Important site: Gebel Sahaba
		- Nubian late Paleolithic cemetery
		- c. 13,500 BP
		- Skeletons are posed and buried in a small area
			- Suggest funerary customs/beliefs
			- Suggest social ties/communities
		- Parts of stone tools embedded in skeletons
			- Suggests conflict of some level

# Neolithic Period
- Features of the Neolithic Period
	- Marked by a switch from BP to BC/BCE dating
	- Times
		- Saharan Neolithic
		- Lower Egyptian Neolithic and Chalcolithic
	- "New Stone Age"
		- Emergence of ceramic goods
		- Greater distinction between cultures
- Sahara Neolithic
	- Ceramic production
	- Cattle herding
	- Important site: Nabta Playa stone circles
		- Nubia
		- Summer camp location - we know that they were not yet settled in one place
		- Stones were not from close by
		- Likely religious or ceremonial in nature
		- Surrounded by temporary domestic buildings
		- Remains of cattle and other foodstuff preparation tools
- Lower Egyptian Neolithic
	- Different cultures named by site
		- Fayum
		- Merimde
		- Maadi
	- Evidence of sedentary settlements and more long-term living
	- Fayum (c. 5450 - 5500 BCE)
		- Small and sharp tools as opposed to large hand axes
		- Ceramics like bowls
		- Emergence of agriculture evidenced by silos
	- Merimde (c. 4800 - 4300 BCE)
		- The human head/mask thing
		- Baskets
		- Grain silos
		- Individual houses
		- Burials scattered amongst the houses
