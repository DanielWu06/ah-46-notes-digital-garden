# Badarian culture
- Basically the only Upper Egyptian Predynastic period to occur before Lower Egyptian periods
- Use of ivory
	- Imported from the Levant
	- Farmed from hippos
	- Suggests the development of different social roles
- Settlements were likely very close to the Nile
	- Not many survived
- Cemeteries in the desert
	- Separation between living space and place for the dead
	- Did not get flooded; better preserved
	- Some burials had a lot of grave goods, some didn't
		- Suggests social stratification
