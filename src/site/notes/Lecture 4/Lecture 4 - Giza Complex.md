- Guy with the big mf pyramid
- The only statue we have of him, also really small

## Hemiunu
![hemiunustatue.png|156x333](/img/user/Images/hemiunustatue.png)
- Likely architect of the great pyramid
- Nephew to Khufu
- Does not look as young or fit as a king
	- Sometimes considered realism
	- Could also be idealism
		- He had access to good food
		- He was rich and had resources
	- Either way, it's probably not 1:1 and some sort of idealization of his status
