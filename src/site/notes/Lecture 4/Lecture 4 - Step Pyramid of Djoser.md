	- Obstacle-course style thing
- Similar things
	- Seen in [[Lecture 3/Lecture 3 - Naqada II#^ade58b\|Tomb 100]]
	- See in [[Lecture 4/Lecture 4 - Umm el-Qaab#^43ea09\|tombs in Umm el-Qaab]]
![hebsednorthsouth.png|409x301](/img/user/Images/hebsednorthsouth.png)
- Depictions with crowns of both Upper and Lower Egypt
	- Shows unification power
	- Importance of being strong enough to unify Egypt
- Importance of Heb-sed at the tomb
	- Why would a dead king need to do this?
		- Royal power remained relevant after death
		- King had to prove his own worth and power in the afterlife
	- How does this change the function of the pyramid?
		- Shifts from being just a burial place to a memorial
		- Elevates both Djoser himself and the institution of kingship
		- Monuments shift from being about one specific guy to the idea of the king
