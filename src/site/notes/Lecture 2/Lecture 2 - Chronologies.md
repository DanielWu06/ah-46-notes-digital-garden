# Dating

- Absolute dating
	- Produce specific chronological dates
	- Not widely available until 20th century
	- Not used much for Egyptology
- Relative dating
	- Produce chronological hierarchies or relative chronology
- Absolute dating precision in Ancient Egypt
	- 644 BCE onwards: dating is precise
	- 1500 - 644 BCE: $\pm$ 20 years
	- 2000 - 1500 BCE: $\pm$ 50 years
	- Pre 2000 BCE: $\pm$ 100 years
		- We can see that this is horribly imprecise!
		- Therefore, we would prefer to use relative dating where possible

# Absolute Dating
- C14 dating
	- Carbon 14 present in living organisms
	- Decays at a know rate, allows us to calculate their lifetimes
	- However, samples can't leave Egypt, so it becomes more difficult
- Dendrochronology
	- Tree ring data
	- Not particularly useful for Egypt
- Astronomical Observations
	- Maps Egyptian dates to modern calendars
	- Specific events or anomalies that were documented can provide dates
	- Cross-reference with other ancient Near East cultures

# Relative Dating
- Seriation
{ #5819db}

	- We put things into series or progressions
		- Think of this in terms of car models, computer releases, etc
	- Allows for a relative timeline with dates in order
	- Does not rely as much on super precise absolute dating
- Texts and documentation
	- Based on kings and dynasties
	- Allows us to construct a rough timeline of events
- King lists
	- Literal lists of kings
	- Allows us to put kings in order
	- Were not meant as historical documents, but rather decoration
		- Not objective or historically accurate all the time
		- May reflect the king's worldview
