# The Importance of the Nile

- [[Lecture 1/Lecture 1 - Introduction to Ancient Egypt#^2ed46f\|The Nile was crucial to Egyptian life and identity]]
- Nile was considered sacred, and so it was personified and deified as Hapi
	- He represented plenty and fertility
	- Color, stomach, etc. were all symbolic
		- Blue for the water of the Nile
		- Green for the fertile land
		- Large stomach and swelling breasts for prosperity
		- Belt of a marsh-dweller for his ties to the Nile
- 4100 KM, maybe the longest river in the world
- Flowed from south to north
- 6 Nile cataracts in Nubia
	- Hindered river travel
	- Reduced agricultural fertility in Nubia
	- Distinction between uses of Nile in Egypt and Nubia

# Natural Resources

- Nubia had gold, which was not present in Egypt
	- Crux of cross-cultural interactions between the two
	- Caused a lot of conflict over resources
- South
	- Sandstone
	- Red granite
	- Amethyst
- North
	- Limestone
	- Copper
- Resources moved around
	- Trading, transport, etc.
	- However, these materials could inform the primary construction materials for temples and other buildings

# Construction and Architecture

- Mudbrick
	- Bricks made out of mud
	- Mud was put into mold and retrieved when dried out
	- Very common building material
- Mudbrick vs stone
	- Mudbrick was less durable
	- Buildings made of stone were better preserved, which influences the types of information that we have available

# Relationships with Other Cultures
- Groups of interaction
	- Kush (Nubians)
	- Asiatics (modern-day Palestine area)
	- Libyans (later)
	- [[Lecture 2/Lecture 2 - The Historical Record#^a701e3\|Greeks]] (later)
- Trade as a form of interactionism
	- Not all relationships were hostile, and trade was very important
	- For example, common trades included resources such as gold or lapis lazuli
- Conflicts over culture, resources, etc
- Enemies of Egypt: The Nine bows
	- Nine represented infinity
	- Essentially meant all enemies of Egypt
- Portrayal
	- Often relied on stereotypical depictions
