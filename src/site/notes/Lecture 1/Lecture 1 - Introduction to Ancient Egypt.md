# A Basic Geography

## Map of Egypt
![Map of the Nile.png|342x237](/img/user/Images/Map%20of%20the%20Nile.png)
- Black Land and Red Land
{ #2ed46f}

	- Black Land refers to the fertile land along the Nile
		- Included the Nile delta and Nile banks
		- Plentiful food and water to support a culture
	- Red Land refers to the reddish colored sands
		- The Egyptian word for this red land was "deshret" (modern day desert)
		- Egyptians did not consider this to be a part of Egypt proper, since it was inhospitable and far away from the Nile
- Upper and Lower Egypt
	- Upper Egypt is in the South
	- Lower Egypt is in the North
	- This reflects the South to North flow of the Nile River
