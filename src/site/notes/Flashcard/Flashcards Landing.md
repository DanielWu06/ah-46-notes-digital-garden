## Cramming Manually
Cramming on Anki is a bit of a pain in the ass since it's meant for spaced repetition, but there are a few ways around it, or just download the cramming version.
### OPTION 1: CUSTOM STUDY SESSION
1. Exhaust the study list (27 cards for the midterm)
2. Go select custom study on the page you get to at the end
3. Select "Study by card state or tag"
4. Select "All cards in random order (don't reschedule)"

### OPTION 2: PREVIEWS
This is strictly worse, but if for some reason you can't do a custom study session then this is the only option
1. Go to "Browse"
2. Select the correct deck (Art History 46)
3. Click "Preview" on the top right side toolbar
